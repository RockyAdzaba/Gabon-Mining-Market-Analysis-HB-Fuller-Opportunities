penetration by Year 3
Why Now? The Window of 
Opportunity is Closing
MARKET TIMING
Gabon's mining sector is at inflection point (6% ³ 25% GDP 
by 2030)
$1B+ addressable market expanding NOW
Government actively seeking foreign investment 
partnerships
COMPETITIVE PRESSURE
International competitors already positioning in market 
(Q1-Q2 2025)
First-mover advantage critical for market share capture
Local players lack technical sophistication - our advantage 
window is 12-18 months
CLIENT READINESS
Eramet Comilog and Nouvelle Gabon Mining actively 
seeking solutions
Operational challenges creating urgent demand for 
efficiency improvements
Budget cycles align for Q1 2025 contract negotiations

immediately to establish presence and secure pilot contracts.
Overview
Strategic Opportunity in a High-Growth Market
Gabon's mining sector is experiencing unprecedented 
growth, positioned to become a cornerstone of the nation's 
economy. As the world's third-largest manganese producer, 
the country is rapidly expanding into iron ore, potash, and 
gold extraction.
With government backing and substantial foreign 
investment, the sector is projected to grow from 6% to 25% 
of GDP by 2030. This expansion creates significant demand 
for industrial solutions that enhance operational efficiency 
and ensure compliance.

Market Landscape: Minerals & 
Production
Primary Focus
Manganese remains the 
dominant mineral, critical for 
steel production and emerging 
EV battery markets, 
establishing Gabon as a key 
global supplier.
Emerging Resources
Growth Sectors
Iron ore and potash projects 
are rapidly scaling, with major 
investments from international 
operators driving 
diversification.
Gold, copper, uranium, and bauxite present additional 
opportunities as exploration and development activities intensify.
Total mineral production reached 15.2 million tonnes in 2024, with Gabon 
ranking 64th globally. The government's strategic push for sector 
expansion creates a favorable environment for industrial solution 
providers.

Critical Operational Challenges
Equipment & Maintenance
Heavy wear on machinery, conveyor belt failures, and pipeline leaks 
lead to costly downtime. Ore processing inefficiencies and frequent 
maintenance cycles strain operational budgets.
Infrastructure Limitations
Limited energy supply, inadequate railway capacity, and 
maintenance delays create bottlenecks. Off-grid operations drive up 
costs and complicate logistics.
Safety & Compliance
Elevated safety risks, particularly in small-scale operations. Robust 
regulatory framework exists, but inconsistent enforcement creates 
compliance challenges.
Environmental Pressures
Deforestation, soil degradation, and water pollution demand urgent 
attention. Companies face increasing pressure to meet 
environmental and local content regulations.
